This project is a DBMS project titled Hostel Management System.
The database has 6 tables, namely: Student table, Hostel table, Room table, Administrator table, Furniture table and the Visitor table.
  The tables are connected using concepts of Primary keys and Secondary keys. Triggers are used to make update/delete queries, if made.

The front-end was designed using php.
Xampp was used to integrate the front-end with the back-end. It runs an Apache and a MySQL Server of Port 3307.

Here are a few screenshots of the front end:
